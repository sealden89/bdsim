Much of this code is directly imported from Geant4. It is not provided as part of the Geant4
code base itself, but as part of one of the examples. The classes have been renamed so as not
to clash in the future with any built-into-geant4 implementation. While based on the Geant4
example (and hence the copy of the licence in each file), modifications have been made to
improve upon it.
