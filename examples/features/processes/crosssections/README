TL;DR

cd  ./protons/01_ftfp_bert/01_hydrogen/
python solidhydrogen_1mm_ftfp_bert.py


CROSS-SECTION EXAMPLES

Examples of cross-section extraction from thin target scattering in BDSIM
Cross sections are calculated based on the ratio of interacting vs. non-interacting particles through the a target.
Different processes can be selected, the default ones are hardronic elastic and hardonic inelastic

The intended directory strucure is as follows:

particle_type -> physics_list -> target_material

Currently, the case of  protons with ftfp_bert modular physics list on a hydrogen target.
The directory structure is shown below. The Common directory includes gmad template files, data for comparisonand python 
files with functionality shared by the different cases - setting up the run, calculating cross-sections, making plots.

The particle+physics_list+target combinations should come with a python file that can be executed to perform the run.
All the neccessary configurations are included in this file.
