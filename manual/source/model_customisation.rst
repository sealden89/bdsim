Fields
------

BDSIM provides the facility to overlay magnetic, electric, or combined electromagnetic fields
on an element, as defined by an externally provided field map. A field map is an array of evenly
space points in **Cartesian** coordinates that define the field as a 3-vector at that point.
A field can be applied to an element of piece of geometry for

1) only the "vacuum" volume
2) only the volume outside the vacuum (i.e. the yoke)
3) or one full map for the whole element.

BDSIM allows any Geant4 integrator to be used to calculate the motion of the particle, which
can be chosen given knowledge of the smoothness of the field or the application (default is
a 4th order Runge Kutta). BDSIM also provides
a selection of 1-4D interpolators that are used to provide the field value in between the data points
in the supplied field map.

To overlay a field, one must define a field 'object' in the parser and then 'attach' it to an element.

* Fields are in a local Cartesian coordinate system with respect to the origin of the
  element they are attached to.
* The field may be attached to everything "fieldAll"; the vacuum volume "fieldVacuum", or the yoke "fieldOuter".
* Magnetic and electric field maps are specified in separate files and may have different interpolators.
* Fields may have up to four dimensions.
* The dimensions are (by default) in order :math:`x,y,z,t`. For example, specifying a 3D field will be
  :math:`x,y,z` and a 2D field :math:`x,y`.
* Cubic interpolation is used by default unless otherwise specified.
* Geant4's classical 4th order Runge Kutta is used as the default numerical integrator.

For BDSIM format fields (see :ref:`model-description-field-formats`, :ref:`field-map-formats` and
:ref:`fields-different-dimensions`),
the user can however specify different dimension with the other dimensions being assumed constant.
For example, a field that varies in :math:`x,z` is possible (assumed constant in :math:`y`). For
BDSIM format fields, this is detected automatically by the column labelling and the keys in the
header of the file that specify the ranges in each dimension. The dimensions must however be in
ascending or descending order.

.. Note:: Currently only **regular** (evenly spaced) grids are supported with field maps. It would
	  require significant development to extend this to irregular grids. It's strongly
	  recommended the user re-sample any existing field map into a regular grid. A regular
	  grid is also much faster for tracking purposes.

Here is a minimal example of a magnetic field in BDSIM format::

  detfield: field, type="bmap3d",
                   magneticFile="bdsim3d:fieldmap.dat.gz";

This will use the "g4classicalrk4" integrator for the particle motion and the "cubic" (in 3D) interpolation
by default.
	  
Here is example syntax to define a field object named 'somefield' in the parser and overlay it onto
a drift pipe where it covers the full volume of the drift (not outside it though)::

  somefield: field, type="ebmap2d",
		    eScaling = 3.0,
		    bScaling = 0.4,
		    integrator = "g4classicalrk4",
		    magneticFile = "poisson2d:/Path/To/File.TXT",
		    magneticInterpolator = "nearest",
		    electricFile = "poisson2d:/Another/File.TXT",
		    electricInterpolator = "linear";

  d1: drift, l=0.5*m, aper1=4*cm, fieldAll="somefield";

Each beam line element will allow "fieldAll", "fieldVacuum" and "fieldOuter" to be specified.

When defining a field, the following parameters can be specified.

.. Note:: Either axis angle (with unit axis 3-vector) or Euler angles can be used to provide
	  the rotation between the element the field maps are attached to and the coordinates
	  of the field map. Use `axisAngle=1` to use the axis angle rotation scheme.

.. Note:: A right-handed coordinate system is used in Geant4, so positive x is out of a ring.

Field maps in the following formats are accepted:

  * BDSIM's own format (both uncompressed :code:`.dat` and gzip compressed files. :code:`gz` must be
    in the file name for this to load correctly.)
  * Superfish Poisson 2D SF7

These are described in detail below. More field formats can be added
relatively easily - see :ref:`feature-request`. A detailed description
of the formats is given in :ref:`field-map-formats`. A preparation guide
for BDSIM format files is provided here :ref:`field-map-file-preparation`.


Integrators
^^^^^^^^^^^

The following integrators are provided.  The majority are interfaces to Geant4 integrators.
*g4classicalrk4* is typically the recommended default and is very robust.
*g4cakskarprkf45* is similar but slightly less CPU-intensive. For version Geant4.10.4
onwards, *g4dormandprince745* is the default recommended by Geant4 (although not the
BDSIM default currently). Note: any integrator capable of operating on EM fields
will work on solely B- or E-fields.

We recommend looking at the source .hh files in the Geant4 source code for an
explanation of each, as this is where they are documented. The source files can
be found in `<geant4-source-dir>/source/geometry/magneticfield/include`.

Interpolators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The field may be queried at any point inside the volume, so an interpolator is required
to provide a value of the field in between specified points in the field map.
There are many algorithms that can be used to interpolate the field map data. A
mathematical description of the ones provided in BDSIM as well as example plots
is shown in :ref:`field-interpolators`.

* This string is case-insensitive.

| linear     | Linear interpolation            |
+------------+---------------------------------+
| cubic      | Cubic interpolation             |
+------------+---------------------------------+

Internally there is a different implementation for different numbers of dimensions and this
is automatically chosen based on the number of dimensions in the field map type.

.. _fields-sub-fields:

Sub-Fields
^^^^^^^^^^

A 'sub-field' is where one field map can be overlaid on top of another. The sub-field should be smaller
and will simply take precedence on the main field within its range. This is useful if for example a
precise field detailed field map is required for a smaller region but a coarser field map is suitable
for the majority of the component. Remember, field maps must contain regularly spaced data so if a high
density of points is required in one point, this would lead to an excessively large field map for the rest
of the element which may not be necessary and slow the loading and running of the simulation.

Inside the domain of the sub-field, only its interpolated value is used. The transition between the sub
and main field is hard and it is left to the user to ensure that the field values are continuous to
make physical sense.

* Currently only sub-magnetic fields are supported.
* The tilt or rotation of the field map (with respect to the element it is attached to) does not
  apply to the region of applicability for the subfield. However, the field is tilted appropriately.
* The spatial (only) offset (x,y,z) of the sub-field applies to it independently of the offset of the
  main outer field.
* If a 2D field is used both fields apply infinitely in z in a 3D model, therefore the sub-field
  will always take precedence for any z value as long as x and y are inside its limits.

Below is an example of a sub-field that can be found in :code:`bdsim/examples/features/fields/subfield`: ::

  fpipe: field, type="bmap2d",
       	        magneticFile="bdsim2d:inner.dat",
	        magneticInterpolator="nearest",
	        x=-10*cm;

  fyoke: field, type="bmap2d",
       	        magneticFile="bdsim2d:outer.dat",
	        magneticInterpolator="cubic",
	        magneticSubField="fpipe";

  d1: drift, l=0.5*m, aper1=0.5*m, fieldAll="fyoke";

First a smaller field map is defined called "fpipe". Secondly, a larger coarser field map is created
called "fyoke" that crucially refers to the :code:`magneticSubField="fpipe"`. The sub-field applies
only in the range of the field map taken from the maximum and minimum coordinates in each dimension
when loading the field map. In the provided example, the "inner.dat" field map defines 4 points in a
2D square at +- 20 cm in both x and y with the same B field vector. Nearest neighbour interpolation
is used to ensure a perfect uniform field inside these points.

The second field definition using "outer.dat" ranges from +- 50 cm with a similar box of 4 points in 2D.
Each point has the same field value but with an opposing x component. The Python script used to create
these simple field maps is included alongside the example. The example combined field map is shown
in the visualiser below. The magnetic field lines were visualised using the Geant4 visualiser command
:code:`/vis/scene/add/magneticField 10 lightArrow`.

.. _materials-and-atoms:
	  
Materials and Atoms
-------------------

All chemical elements are available in BDSIM as well as the Geant4 NIST database
of materials for use. Custom materials and can also be added via the parser. All materials
available in BDSIM can be found by executing BDSIM with the :code:`--materials` option. ::

  bdsim --materials

Aside from these, several materials useful for accelerator applications are already defined
that are listed in :ref:`predefined-materials`.

Generally, each beam line element accepts an argument "material" that is the
material used for that element. It is used differently depending on the element. For example,
in the case of a magnet, it is used for the yoke and for a collimator for the collimator
block.

Single Element
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the case of an element, the chemical symbol can be specified::

  rc1: rcol, l=0.6*m, xsize=1.2*cm, ysize=0.6*cm, material="W";

These are automatically prefixed with :code:`G4_` and retrieved from the NIST database of
materials.

The user can also define their own material and then refer to it by name when defining
a beam line element.

Custom Single Element Material
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the material required is composed of a single element, but say of a different density or
state than the default NIST one provided, it can be defined using the **matdef**
command with the following syntax::

  materialname : matdef, Z=<int>, A=<double>, density=<double>, T=<double>, P=<double>, state=<char*>;

=========  ========================== =============
Parameter  Description                Default
Z          Atomic number
A          Mass number [g/mol]
density    Density in [g/cm3]
T          Temperature in [K]         300
P          Pressure [atm]             1
state      "solid", "liquid" or "gas" "solid"
=========  ========================== =============

Example::

  iron2 : matdef, Z=26, A=55.845, density=7.87;

A compound material can be specified in two manners:

Compound Material by Atoms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If the number of atoms of each component in a material unit is known,
the following syntax can be used::

   <material> : matdef, density=<double>, T=<double>, P=<double>,
                state=<char*>, components=<[list<char*>]>,
                componentsWeights=<{list<int>}>;

================= ===================================================
Parameter         Description
density           Density in [g/cm3]
components        List of symbols for material components
componentsWeights Number of atoms for each component in material unit
================= ===================================================

Example::

  NbTi : matdef, density=5.6, T=4.0, components=["Nb","Ti"], componentsWeights={1,1};

Compound Material by Mass Fraction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On the other hand, if the mass fraction of each component is known, the
following syntax can be used::

   <material> : matdef, density=<double>, T=<double>, P=<double>,
                state=<char*>, components=<[list<char*>]>,
                componentsFractions=<{list<double>}>;

=================== ================================================
Parameter           Description
components          List of symbols for material components
componentsFractions Mass fraction of each component in material unit
=================== ================================================

Example::

  SmCo : matdef, density=8.4, T=300.0, components=["Sm","Co"], componentsFractions = {0.338,0.662};

The second syntax can also be used to define materials which are composed by
other materials (and not by atoms).

.. note:: Square brackets are required for the list of element symbols, curly
	  brackets for the list of weights or fractions.

New elements can be defined with the **atom** keyword::

  elementname : atom, Z=<int>, A=<double>, symbol=<char*>;

=========  =====================
Parameter  Description
Z          Atomic number
A          Mass number [g/mol]
symbol     Atom symbol
=========  =====================

Example::

  myNiobium  : atom, symbol="myNb", Z=41, A=92.906;
  myTitanium : atom, symbol="myTi", Z=22, A=47.867;
  myNbTi     : matdef, density=5.6, T=4.0, components=["myNb","myTi"], componentsWeights={1,1};

Vacuum and Air
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The default "vacuum" material used in all beam pipes is composed of H, C and O with the
following fractions:

+--------------+-------------------+
| **Element**  | **Mass Fraction** |
+==============+===================+
| H            | 0.482             |
+--------------+-------------------+
| C            | 0.221             |
+--------------+-------------------+
| O            | 0.297             |
+--------------+-------------------+

The default pressure is 1e-12 bar, the temperature is 300K and the density is 1.16336e-15 g/cm3.

"air" is the G4_AIR material. As of Geant4.10.04.p02
(see geant4/source/materials/src/G4NistMaterialBuilder.cc), it is composed of C, N, O, Ar
with the following fractions:

+--------------+-------------------+
| **Element**  | **Mass Fraction** |
+==============+===================+
| C            | 0.000124          |
+--------------+-------------------+
| N            | 0.755267          |
+--------------+-------------------+
| O            | 0.231781          |
+--------------+-------------------+
| Ar           | 0.012827          |
+--------------+-------------------+

It is a gas with density of 1.20479 mg/cm3.

.. _aperture-parameters:

Aperture Parameters
-------------------

For elements that contain a beam pipe, several aperture models can be used. These aperture
parameters can be set as the default for every element using the :code:`option` command
(see :ref:`bdsim-options`) and
can be overridden for each element by specifying them with the element definition. The aperture
is controlled through the following parameters:

* `apertureType`
* `beampipeRadius` or `aper1`
* `aper2`
* `aper3`
* `aper4`
* `vacuumMaterial`
* `beampipeThickness`
* `beampipeMaterial`


For each aperture model, a different number of parameters are required. Here, we follow the MAD-X
convention and have four parameters. The user must specify them as required for that model.
BDSIM will check to see if the combination of parameters is valid. `beampipeRadius` and `aper1`
are degenerate.

Up to four parameters
can be used to specify the aperture shape (*aper1*, *aper2*, *aper3*, *aper4*).
These are used differently for each aperture model and match the MAD-X aperture definitions.
The required parameters and their meaning are given in the following table.

.. note:: If no beam pipe is desired, :code:`apertureType="circularvacuum"` can be used that makes
	  only the vacuum volume without any beam pipe. The vacuum material is the usual vacuum
	  but can of course can be controlled with :code:`vacuumMaterial`. So you could create
	  a magnet with air and no beam pipe.

+-------------------+--------------+-------------------+-----------------+----------------+------------------+

These parameters can be set with the *option* command, as the default parameters
and also on a per element basis that overrides the defaults for that specific element.

In the case of `clicpcl` (CLIC Post Collision Line), the beam pipe is asymmetric. The centre is
the same as the geometric centre of the bottom ellipse. Therefore, *aper4*, the y separation
between ellipses is added on to the 0 position. The parameterisation is taken from
Phys. Rev. ST Accel. Beams **12**, 021001 (2009).

.. _magnet-geometry-parameters:

Magnet Geometry Parameters
--------------------------

As well as the beam pipe, magnet beam line elements also have further outer geometry beyond the
beam pipe. This geometry typically represents the magnetic poles and yoke of the magnet but there
are several geometry types to choose from. The possible different styles are described below and
syntax **examples** can be found in *examples/features/geometry/4_magnets/*.

* Externally provided geometry can also be wrapped around the beam pipe (detailed below).

The magnet geometry is controlled by the following parameters.

.. note:: These can all be specified using the `option` command as well as on a per element
	  basis, but in this case they act as a default that will be used if none are
	  specified by the element.

.. note:: The option :code:`ignoreLocalMagnetGeometry` exists and if it is true (1), any
	  per-element magnet geometry definitions will be ignored and the ones specified
	  in Options will be used.

.. note:: In the case that the `lhcleft` or `lhcright` magnet geometry types are used,
	  the yoke field will be a sum of two regular yoke fields at the LHC beam pipe
	  separation. The option :code:`yokeFielsMatchLHCGeometry` can be used to control
	  this. These are described in :ref:`fields-multipole-outer-lhc`.

Examples: ::

          horizontalWidth = 0.5*m;

::

                   k1=0.03,
		   magnetGeometryType="gdml:geometryfiles/quad.gdml",
		   horizontalWidth = 0.5*m;

.. warning:: The choice of magnet outer geometry will significantly affect the beam loss pattern in the
	     simulation, as particles and radiation may propagate much further along the beam line when
	     a magnet geometry with poles is used.

.. note:: Should a custom selection of various magnet styles be required for your simulation, please
	  contact us (see :ref:`feature-request`) and this can be added - it is a relatively simple process.

No Magnet Outer Geometry - "`none`"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

No geometry for the magnet outer part is built at all and nothing is placed in the model. This results
in only a beam pipe with the correct fields being provided.

.. image:: figures/none_beamline.png
	   :width: 60%
	   :align: center

Cylindrical - "`cylindrical`"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The beam pipe is surrounded by a cylinder of material (the default is iron) whose outer diameter
is controlled by the `horizontalWidth` parameter. In the case of beam pipes that are not circular
in cross-section, the cylinder fits directly against the outside of the beam pipe.

This geometry is useful when a specific geometry is not known. The surrounding
magnet volume acts to produce secondary radiation as well as act as material for energy deposition,
therefore this geometry is best suited for the most general studies.

.. figure:: figures/cylindrical_quadrupole.png
	    :width: 40%

.. figure:: figures/cylindrical_sextupole.png
	    :width: 40%


Poles Circular - "`polescircular`"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This magnet geometry has simple iron poles according to the order of the magnet and the yoke is
represented by an annulus. Currently no coils are implemented. If a non-symmetric beam pipe
geometry is used, the larger of the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the beam pipe will be
used to create the circular aperture at the pole tips.

	    :width: 40%


Poles Square (Default) - "`polessquare`"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This magnet geometry has again, individual poles according to the order of the magnet but the
yoke is an upright square section to which the poles are attached. This geometry behaves in the
same way as `polescircular` with regard to the beam pipe size.

`horizontalWidth` is the full width of the magnet horizontally as shown in the figure below,
**not** the diagonal width.

	    :width: 40%

	    :width: 40%

.. figure:: figures/polessquare_sextupole_3d.png
	    :width: 40%


Poles Faceted - "`polesfacet`"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This magnet geometry is much like `polessquare`; however, the yoke is such that the pole always
joins at a flat piece of yoke and not in a corner. This geometry behaves in the
same way as `polescircular` with regards to the beam pipe size.

`horizontalWidth` is the full width as shown in the figure.

.. figure:: figures/polesfacet_quadrupole.png
	    :width: 40%

.. figure:: figures/polesfacet_sextupole_3d.png
	    :width: 40%


Poles Faceted with Crop - "`polesfacetcrop`"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This magnet geometry is quite similar to `polesfacet`, but the yoke in between each
pole is cropped to form another facet. This results in the magnet geometry having
double the number of poles as sides.

`horizontalWidth` is the full width horizontally as shown in the figure.

LHC Left & Right - "`lhcleft`" | "`lhcright`"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`lhcleft` and `lhcright` provide more detailed magnet geometry appropriate for the LHC. Here, the
left and right suffixes refer to the shift of the magnet body with respect to the reference beam line.
Therefore, `lhcleft` has the magnet body shifted to the left in the direction of beam travel and the
'active' beam pipe is the right one. Vice versa for the `lhcright` geometry.

For this geometry, only the `sbend` and `quadrupole` have been implemented.  All other magnet geometry
defaults to the cylindrical set.

This geometry is parameterised to a degree regarding the beam pipe chosen.  Of course, parameters similar
to the LHC make most sense, as does use of the `lhcdetailed` aperture type. Examples are shown with various
beam pipes and both `sbend` and `quadrupole` geometries.

.. _externally-provided-geometry:

Externally Provided Geometry
----------------------------

BDSIM provides the ability to use externally provided geometry in the Geant4 model constructed
by BDSIM. A variety of formats are supported (see :ref:`geometry-formats`). External
geometry can be used in three ways:

1) A placement of a piece of geometry unrelated to the beam line.
2) Wrapped around the beam pipe in a BDSIM magnet element.
3) As a general element in the beam line where the geometry constitutes the whole object.
4) As the world volume in which the BDSIM beamline is placed.

These are discussed in order in :ref:`placements`, :ref:`external-magnet-geometry` and
:ref:`element-external-geometry`.

.. _geometry-formats:

Geometry Formats
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following geometry formats are supported. More may be added in collaboration with the BDSIM
developers - please see :ref:`feature-request`. The syntax and preparation of these geometry
formats are described in more detail in :ref:`external-geometry-formats`.

+----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Format String**    | **Description**                                                     |
+======================+=====================================================================+

|                      | | persistency format - recommended                                  |

|                      | | geometry classes                                                  |
+----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| mokka                | | An SQL style description of geometry                              |
+----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+

* With the `option, checkOverlaps=1;` turned on, each externally loaded piece of geometry will
  also be checked for overlaps.

.. note:: BDSIM must be compiled with the GDML build option in CMake turned on for gdml loading to work.

.. note:: For GDML geometry, we preprocess the input file prepending all names with the name
	  of the element. This is to compensate for the fact that the Geant4 GDML loader does
	  not handle unique file names. However, in the case of very large files with many
	  vertices, the preprocessing can dominate. In this case, the option `preprocessGDML`
	  should be turned off. The loading will only work with one file in this case.

.. warning:: If a geometry file path is defined relative to the location of the GMAD file and that
	     GMAD file is included in a parent file in a different location, the file will not be
	     correctly located (i.e. main.gmad includes ../somedir/anotherfile.gmad, which defines
	     geometry in "../a/relative/path/geometryfile.gdml". The file will not be found). If all
	     GMAD files are located in the same directory, this will not be a problem. It is better / cleaner
	     overall to use multiple GMAD input files and include them.

.. _external-world-geometry:

External World Geometry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

External geometry can be supplied as the world volume with the option `worldGeometryFile`
(see :ref:`options-geometry`). The BDSIM beamline will be placed inside this world volume
provided in the file. ::

  option, worldGeometryFile="gdml:myworld.gdml";

Unlike the standard BDSIM world volume whose size is
set dynamically, the external world volume will have fixed dimensions, therefore the user should supply
a world volume of sufficient size so as to fully encompass the BDSIM beamline. Should the extents of the
BDSIM beamline be larger than the world extents, the beamline will not be constructed and BDSIM will exit.

`worldGeometryFile` should be of the format `format:filename`, where `format` is the geometry
format being used (`gdml` | `gmad` | `mokka`) and filename is the path to the geometry
file. See :ref:`externally-provided-geometry` for more details.

* See also :ref:`physics-bias-importance-sampling` for usage of this.
* The world **material** will be taken from the GDML file and the option :code:`worldMaterial`
  will be ignored. If the option :code:`worldMaterial` is specified as well as
  :code:`worldGeometryFile`, BDSIM will exit.
* The option :code:`autoColourWorldGeometryFile` can be used (default true) to colour
  the supplied geometry by density. See :ref:`automatic-colours` for details.

.. _placements:

Placements
----------

Geometry provided in an external file may be placed at any location in the world with
any rotation. This is intended to place geometry alongside the beam line and **not** inside
or as part of it. The user is responsible for ensuring that the geometry does not
overlap with any other geometry including the beam line. Only in special cases, such as
for a magnet yoke, can externally provided geometry be placed "inside" BDSIM geometry.

For geometry to be placed in the beam line, use the :ref:`element`.

.. warning:: If the geometry overlaps, tracking faults may occur from Geant4 as well as
	     incorrect results and there may not always be warnings provided. For this reason,
	     BDSIM will **always** use the Geant4 overlap checker when placing external geometry
	     into the world volume. This only ensures the container doesn't overlap with BDSIM
	     geometry, not that the internal geometry is valid.

.. warning:: You cannot place external geometry 'inside' an accelerator component with a
	     placement. Although it may appear OK in the visualiser, the hierarchy of the
	     geometry will be wrong and the tracking will not work as expected. Avoid this.

There are 3 possible ways to place a piece of geometry.

1) In global Cartesian coordinates.

   - `x`, `y`, `z` and any rotation are with respect to the world frame of reference.


2) In curvilinear coordinates.

   - `s`, `x`, `y` are used along with a rotation. The transform for the distance `s` along the beamline
     is first applied. `x`, `y` and the rotation are with respect to that frame.


3) In curvilinear coordinates with respect to a beam line element by name.

   - The name of an element is used to look up its (mid-point) `s` coordinate. `s`, `x`, `y` and the rotation
     are with respect to the centre of that element. **Therefore**, `s` in this case is `local` curvilinear
     `s`.

The scenario is automatically selected based on which parameters are set. If `s` is finite, then
it is either scenario 2 or 3. If `referenceElement` is specified, scenario 3 is assumed.

.. warning:: For both scenarios 2) and 3), a placement can only be made **inside** the S length of
	     the accelerator - it is not possible to place something beyond the accelerator currently.
	     In this case, the user should resort to a global placement.
	     
The following parameters may be specified with a placement in BDSIM:

+-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Parameter**           |  **Description**                                                   |

+-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+

+-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| axisAngle               | Boolean whether to use axis angle rotation scheme (default false)  |
+-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| sensitive               | Whether the geometry records energy deposition (default true)      |
+-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| referenceElement        | Name of element to place geometry with respect to (string)         |
+-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| referenceElementNumber  | Occurrence of `referenceElement` to place with respect to if it    |
|                         | is used more than once in the sequence. Zero counting.             |
+-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| autoColour              | Boolean whether the geometry should be automatically coloured by   |
|                         | density if no colour information is supplied. (default true)       |
+-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+

`referenceElementNumber` is the occurrence of that element in the sequence. For example, if a sequence
was: ::

  l1: line=(d1,sb1,d2,qd1,d2,df1,d2,sb1,d1);

and we wanted to place with respect to the first element, we would use::

  p1: placement, referenceElement="d1",
                 referenceElementNumber=0;

If 0, the `referenceElementNumber` argument is optional. If we want to place with respect to
the third usage of "d2", we would use::

  p1: placement, referenceElement="d2",
                 referenceElementNumber=3;

.. note:: Dipoles are split in BDSIM into many small straight sections. These must have a unique
	  name to appear correctly in the Geant4 visualisation system. The splitting is done
	  dynamically based on the angle of the bend and if it has pole face rotations on one
	  or both sides. The names are mangled and so the original name will not be found.
	  The user should run the visualiser first
	  and identify the name of the segment of the dipole they wish to place with respect to.
	  Alternatively, in the case of low angle bends, the element before or after can be used
	  with a finite `s` offset.

* Examples can be found in :code:`bdsim/examples/features/geometry/13_placements`.
* The file path provided in :code:`geometryFile` should either be relative to where bdsim
  is executed from or an absolute path.
* The main beam line begins at (0,0,0) by default but may be offset.  See
  :ref:`beamline-offset` for more details.


Two styles of rotation can be used: either a set of three Euler angles, or the axis angle
rotation scheme, where a **unit** vector is provided in :math:`x,y,z` and an angle to
rotate about that. These variables are used to construct a :code:`G4RotationMatrix`
directly, which is also the same as a :code:`CLHEP::HepRotation`.

.. Note:: Geant4 uses a right-handed coordinate system and :math:`m` and :math:`rad` are
	  the default units for offsets and angles in BDSIM.

The following is an example syntax used to place a piece of geometry::

  leadblock: placement, x = 10*m,
                        y = 3*cm,
			z = 12*m,
			geometryFile="gdml:mygeometry/detector.gdml";

.. warning:: Care must be taken not to define the same placement name twice. If `leadblock`
	     were declared again here, the first definition would be updated with parameters
	     from the second, leading to possibly unexpected geometry.
	     
.. _external-magnet-geometry:

External Magnet Geometry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A geometry file may be placed around a beam pipe inside a BDSIM magnet instance. The beam pipe
will be constructed as normal and will use the appropriate BDSIM tracking routines, but the
yoke geometry will be loaded from the file provided. The external geometry must have a cut out
in its container volume for the beam pipe to fit, i.e. both the beam pipe and the yoke exist
at the same level in the geometry hierarchy (both are placed in one container for the magnet).
The beam pipe is not placed 'inside' the yoke.

This will work for `solenoid`, `sbend`, `rbend`, `quadrupole`, `sextupole`, `octupole`,
`decapole`, `multipole`, `muonspoiler`, `vkicker`, `hkicker` element types in BDSIM.

Example::

  q1: quadrupole, l=20*cm, k1=0.0235, magnetGeometryType="gdml:mygeometry/atf2quad.gdml";


* :code:`autoColour=1` can also be used to automatically colour the supplied geometry by
  density if desired. This is on by default.  Example to turn it off:

::
  q1: quadrupole, l=20*cm, k1=0.0235, magnetGeometryType="gdml:mygeometry/atf2quad.gdml", autoColour=0;


.. _element-external-geometry:

Element
^^^^^^^

A general piece of geometry may be placed in the beam line along with any externally provided
field map using the `element` beam line element.  See `element`_.

  
.. _tunnel-geometry:

Tunnel Geometry
---------------

BDSIM can build a tunnel around the beam line. Currently, there are two main ways to control this.

1) The tunnel follows the beam line, bending automatically (recommended)
2) The tunnel is just built in a straight line - this may be useful for linear colliders but
   may also cause geometry overlaps (the user is responsible for checking this!)

.. warning:: With option 2, the user is entirely responsible to ensure no overlaps occur
	     (through good design). Also note that the samplers may overlap the tunnel
	     depending on the tunnel geometry (samplers are square with half-width of
	     `samplerRadius`). In practice, however, we haven't observed many ill effects
	     because of this. Problems would take the form of 'stuck particles' and
	     Geant4 would terminate that event.

Examples of tunnel geometry can be found with the BDSIM source code in */examples/features/geometry/tunnel*
and are described in :ref:`tunnel-examples`.

The automatic tunnel building is controlled through the following options used with the
:code:`option` command.

These parameters are shown schematically in the figure below (gaps not to scale, elliptical

The soil around the tunnel is typically symmetric, with the `tunnelSoilThickness` being added to
the larger of the horizontal and vertical tunnel dimensions.

Construction of the tunnel geometry may fail in particular cases of different beam lines.
Beam lines with very strong bends ( > 0.5 rad) over a few metres may cause overlapping
geometry. In future, it will be possible to override the automatic algorithm between
certain elements in the beamline, but for now such situations must be avoided.

.. note:: Surrounding the beam line with a tunnel completely means that every particle simulated
	  will have to eventually hit something and not escape. This means that every single particle
	  will likely create a shower of particles down to 0 energy. This can increase simulation time.
	  To avoid this, or at least control this behaviour, it is recommended to use the options
	  :code:`minimumKineticEnergyTunnel` or :code:`tunnelIsInfiniteAbsorber`.



.. _crystals:

Crystals
--------

To use various crystal components in BDSIM such as :ref:`element-crystal-col`, a crystal definition
must first be made. This contains all of the required information to construct the
crystal. The following parameters are required:

+-------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Parameter**     | **Description**                                            |

+-------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| bendingAngleZAxis | Angle that the crystal is bent about Z-axis [rad].         |
+-------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+

* (*) Note, the units of metres may seem ridiculous, but the parser is consistently in S.I.
  (or as much as possible). We recommend using units in the parser such as Angstroms.
  See :ref:`coordinates-and-units`.

.. note:: Depending on the shape chosen, the geometry may or may not represent the bending angle.
	  The `bendingAngleYAxis` is always supplied to the channelling physics process
	  irrespective of the geometry. This is important to note that the crystal may be a box,
	  but the 'crystal' inside (in terms of the physics process) is not related to the geometry
	  and is bent. The physical geometry is merely a volume where the crystal parameters
	  apply.

.. note:: If there is no vertical bending angle, the torus geometry will reduce to the
	  cylinder geometry,  as this is faster for tracking. Similarly, if the cylinder is used
	  and there is no horizontal bending angle, a box will be used, as it's not possible
	  to construct a cylinder with an infinite bending radius.

It is entirely possible to add more shapes to the code. Please contact the developers
:ref:`feature-request`.

Examples: ::

  lovelycrystal: crystal, material = "G4_Si",
	       		data = "data/Si220pl",
			shape = "box",
			lengthY = 5*cm,
			lengthX = 0.5*mm,
			lengthZ = 4*mm,
			sizeA = 5.43*ang,
			sizeB = 5.43*ang,
			sizeC = 5.43*ang,
			alpha = 1,
			beta  = 1,
			gamma = 1,
			spaceGroup = 227,
			bendingAngleYAxis = 0.1*rad,
			bendingAngleZAxis = 0;

.. _colours:

Colours
-------

Most items allow you to define a custom colour for them to aid in visualisation. This includes
all magnets and collimators, the shield and degrader. The colour can be defined with red, green
and blue components, as well as a level of transparency, alpha. RGB values can range from 0
to 255. Once defined, a colour may not be redefined. The syntax to define a colour is

.. code-block:: none

		NAME: newcolour, red=#, green=#, blue=#, alpha=#

Examples: ::
  
  purple: newcolour, red=128, green=0, blue=128;
  col1: rcol, l=0.2*m, xsize=5*cm, ysize=4*cm, colour="purple", material="copper";


and::

  purple: newcolour, red=128, green=0, blue=128;
  orange: newcolour, red=255, green=140, blue=0;
  nicegreen: newcolour, red=0, green=128, blue=0;

  d1: drift, l=1*m;
  basebend: sbend, l=2*m, angle=0.9;
  sb1: basebend, colour="purple";
  sb3: basebend, colour="nicegreen";
  sb4: basebend, colour="yellow";
  sb5: basebend, colour="orange";
  sb6: basebend, colour="red";

  beamline: line=(d1,sb1,d1,basebend,d1,sb3,d1,sb4,d1,sb5,d1,sb6,d1);
  use, beamline;
  sample, all;

  beam,  particle="proton",
         energy= 50*GeV;

This examples if from `bdsim/examples/features/visualisation/coloured_sbend.gmad` and

* Colours can only be specified on an element-by-element basis.
* Colour names are case-sensitive.
* New colour names must not clash with predefined BDSIM colour names.

All available colours in BDSIM can be found by running BDSIM with the :code:`--colours` command: ::

.. _automatic-colours:

Automatic Colours
-----------------

In the case where an automatic colouring option is used, BDSIM can automatically assign a colour
to volumes based on their material for visualisation purposes. This is done with a set of predefined
ones for common elements and materials, and then the fall back is to use the state and the density. The
materials state sets the opacity and the density is used to scale a grey colour. In all cases, the geometry
will be visible.


.. _regions:
			
Regions
-------

In Geant4, it is possible to drive different *regions* - each with their own production cuts and user limits.
In BDSIM, there is one default region to which the options prodCutXXXX apply (see :ref:`bdsim-options`) that applies
everywhere.  Additionally, the user may define additional regions (using the :code:`cutsregion` object)
and attach these to the beam line elements desired.  For example::

  precisionRegion: cutsregion, prodCutProtons=1*m,
                               prodCutElectrons=10*m,
			       prodCutPositrons=10*m,
			       prodCutPhotons = 1*mm;

  d1: drift, l=10*m, region="precisionRegion";

The following parameters are available in the `cutsregion` object:

+--------------------+----------------------------------------+
| **Parmater**       | **Description**                        |
+====================+========================================+
| defaultRangeCut    | The default range cut for this object. |
+--------------------+----------------------------------------+
| prodCutProtons     | The range cut for protons.             |
+--------------------+----------------------------------------+
| prodCutPhotons     | The range cut for photons / gammas.    |
+--------------------+----------------------------------------+
| prodCutElectrons   | The range cut for electrons.           |
+--------------------+----------------------------------------+
| prodCutPositrons   | The range cut for positrons.           |
+--------------------+----------------------------------------+

A range cut is a length that a secondary particle would have to travel in that
material. If it would not travel that distance, then it is not tracked and its
energy deposited there.

Geant4 translates these to an energy scale per particle type per material. This
method is documented as being much more physically accurate than a simple energy
cut across all volumes for all particle types. i.e. the computation time can be
reduced but the physical accuracy maintained in areas of vastly different
density.

* The default for Geant4 is **1 mm** or **0.7 mm** depending on the version.
  This approximately corresponds to keV energy scales in air for most particles.
* The related energies in various materials do not scale linearly or continuously
  with the range parameter. This is ok.

.. warning:: Setting a length scale longer or larger than the beam line element or
	     volume the region will be used in may result in inaccurate physics
	     result and peaks and troughs in energy deposition around boundaries.

* If the `option, defaultRangeCut` is set, this will be the default for the other options
  if not specified.
* If `defaultRangeCut` is not specified in a `cutsregion` object, the default for each
  range will be the corresponding range from the options. e.g. `option, prodCutProtons`
  will be the default for `prodCutProtons` in a `cutsregion` object if `defaultRangeCut`
  is not specified in the object.
* See :code:`bdsim/examples/features/processes/regions` for documented examples.

.. _one-turn-map:

One Turn Map
------------

Geant4 mandates that there are no overlaps between solids, which in
BDSIM means that a thin 1 |nbsp| nm gap is placed between each lattice
element.  Whilst these thin gaps have a negligible effect for a single
pass or turn, over several turns it introduces a sizeable inaccuracy
in the tracking (in the context of large circular models).
To correct for this, BDSIM models can be supplemented
with a one turn map which is applied at the end of each turn to right
the primary back onto the correct trajectory.  To ensure physical
results the one turn map is only applied to primaries, if they did not
interact on the previous turn, and if they are within 5% of the
reference momentum.  The one turn map is also not applied on the first
turn where there the beam is offset in S, but applied on following
turns, still accounting for the exceptions mentioned above.

The map must be of the format as written by MAD-X-PTC's ``PTC_NORMAL``
command.  A one turn map (in this case, 12th order) can be generated
in MAD-X with the following ::

  PTC_CREATE_UNIVERSE;
  PTC_CREATE_LAYOUT, model=2,method=6,nst=10, exact=true, resplit, xbend;
  PTC_NORMAL,maptable,icase=5,no=12;
  write, table="map_table", file="my_oneturn_map_file";
  PTC_END;

To use then use the one turn map with BDSIM ::

  option, ptcOneTurnMapFileName="path/to/my_oneturn_map_file";


* This can only be used with circular machines.
