V1.4 - 2019 / ?? / ??
=====================

Expected Changes To Results
---------------------------

* Any wirescanner elements should be updated to use :code:`wireAngle` instead of :code:`angle` for
  their rotation angle. Not doing this will result in different angles and therefore results.
* Fix for field maps with finite rotations (but not multiples of :math:`\pi/2`). The field will now be correct
  but this may be different from previous releases.
* Field maps now pick up the tilt from the element, so a separate tilt isn't required in the field
  definition as was in the past to make the field align with a tilted element. In this case, the field
  definition tilt should be removed and the field will be orientated to the component it's attached to.

New Features
------------

* New units: `twopi`, `halfpi` and `PeV`.
* New bunch distribution `sphere` to generate random directions at a given point.
* `S0` for bunch offset in curvilinear frame now a documented feature of the bunch.
* Improved event level verbosity.
* All verbosity options now documented, including corresponding executable options.
* BDSIM will now exit if invalid ranges and bins are specified for the single 3D
  energy deposition ('scoring') histogram that can be specified via options.
* New verbose event stepping options. See :ref:`bdsim-options-verbosity` for more details.
* New beam loss monitors (BLMs) with :code:`blm` command (See ref:`detectors-blms`).
* New executable option :code:`--distrFileNLinesSkip` for the number of lines to skip into
  a distribution file.
* New executable option :code:`--nturns` to control the number of turns in a circular machine.
* Support for partially stripped ions in output samplers.
* Optional linking to HepMC3 for event generator output file loading. Can load any format
  HepMC3 can load.
* Ability to print out all particles and physics processes to be helpful for finding Geant4
  names for biasing. See new options below.
* `kaon-`, `kaon+` or `kaon0L` may now be used as beam particles.
* The beam particle may now be specified by its PDG integer ID rather than by name.
* A new physics list called "all_particles" has been introduced to construct all particles
  only but no physics processes. Useful for an exotic beam where only tracking is required.
* New `tilt` parameter for the beam command to apply a rotation about unit Z after the coordinates
  are generated as an easy method to introduce coupling.  Note, this is in the beam command.
* The userfile bunch distribution now supports the column "S" to allow specification of curvilinear
  coordinates as input.
* Field maps are now automatically tilted when attached to a tilted beam line element, whereas
  they weren't before.
* RF cavity fringe fields have been implemented and are on by default. They are controlled with
  the `includeFringeFields` option.

* New options:

General
-------

* Executable verbosity options, now accepted in input gmad.
* Valid default ranges for general single 3D energy deposition 'scoring' histogram
  available through options. Now 1m in x,y,z with 1 bin.
* wirescanner element now uses :code:`wireAngle` for the rotation angle and not :code:`angle`.
* wirescanner element now requires a material to be specified as this makes a large difference
  to the expected result. This should be specified.
* Sampler hits now store rigidity, mass and charge as these are only correct from the G4DynamicParticle
  and cannot be reliably or easily back-calculated afterwards based on the particle definition (PDG ID)
  for partially stripped ions. This storage marginally increases the memory usage per sampler hit, so
  a small increase in memory (RAM) usage may be observed for very large numbers of sampler hits.
* Crystals in crystal collimators are now sensitive as collimators and produce the special collimator
  hit information in the output. The crystal channelling process is ignore as a step defining process
  for generating unique hits in the crystal.
* All processes of type `G4ProcessType::fNotDefined` are excluded from generating collimator specific hits.
* The option `storeCollimatorInfo` now does not store collimator hits for primary particles but only
  the Boolean variables `primaryInteracted` and `primaryStopped` as well as `totalEnergyDeposited` in
  each per-collimator branch in Event. This allows greater control over the amount of information stored.
  The primary hits can be turned on as well with the option `storeCollimatorHits`.
* Remove use of exit(1) throughout the code.
* Element variables "blmLocZ" and "blmLocTheta" were old and removed. These will be rejected in any
  element definition from now on.
* The generic beam line "element" will now be inspected for end piece coil placement on the edge of mangets
  and these will be placed if the pro or preceding geometry is small enough. Previously, coils would only be
  placed if (strictly) drifts were on either side of the magnet.
  
Bug Fixes
---------

* Errors in 2D and 3D merged histograms from events were 0 always. The mean was corrected, but the error
  was not filled correctly - this has been fixed.
* Fix for potential segfault when analysing collimator information branches in event tree. Dependent
  on number of collimators analysed causing std::vector to reallocate and invalidate address of
  pointers as required by ROOT.
* Fix for warnings about unknown collimator branch names when loading data with DataLoader class.
* Fixed warnings about exiting when Geant4 geometry in closed state in the event
  of a warning being produced and BDSIM exiting. Now correctly intercept and re-throw
  the exception.
* Fix a bug where setting a rotation angle for a wire scanner would result in energy deposition
  S coordinates all being -1. This was because the :code:`angle` parameter is assumed to only
  ever be for bends and BDSIM reduces the sampler and curvilinear world (used for coordinate
  transforms) diameter given the maximum bending angle of bends in the whole lattice. This is
  required to avoid overlaps before construction. The new parameter :code:`wireAngle` is used
  instead.
* Fix wire scanner sensitivity. The wire was never sensitive.
* Partial fix for aggressive looping particle killing in Geant4.10.5. For electrons and positrons,
  and the beam particle, the looping threshold has be lowered to 1 keV. Ongoing investigation.
* The rigidity was corrected for partially stripped ions in the sampler output.
* The initial kinetic energy of partially stripped ions was slightly inflated due to subtracting
  the nuclear mass not including the mass of the electrons. The magnetic fields were however
  calculated correctly and this resulted in incorrect behaviour. This has been since fixed.
* Fix a bug where if a userfile with different particle types was used and `-\\-generatePrimariesOnly`
  was used the phase space coordinates would be correct but the mass, charge, rigidity would be
  written wrongly to the output. The particle definition is now updated correctly in the special
  case of generating primaries only where the Geant4 kernel isn't used.
* Fix crystal channelling biasing that was broken with commit #66a6809. This was introduced between
  v1.3.1 and v1.3.2. It resulted in the channelling working but the cross-section biasing not being
  applied and therefore the rest of the physics processes acting as if the block was amorphous.
* Fix `e1`, `e2`, `hgap`, `fint`, `fintx`, `fintk2`, `fintxk2` not being filled in Model tree output.
  They're now filled correctly.
* Fix generic biasing for protons when an ion is used as the beam, or when GenericIon is available in
  the physics list and also biased. Previously, the proton would not be biased but instead only the
  ions would be.
* Fix Event.Summary.memoryUsageMb which was always 0. Also now correct units on linux and Mac. Was previously
  a factor of 1048 too big on linux.
* Fix scaling of relativistic beta in the dipolequadrupole integrator, the particle design beta was
  always was used before regardless of dipole scaling.
* Fix phase term in rf field when frequency is 0. When frequency is 0, the field should be constant and
  maximal, however, it was constant but still modulated by the phase of the incoming particle.
* Fix for default value of "energy" (actually energy loss) in the trajectory branch of the Event tree
  where the default value was -1 whereas it should be 0.
* Fix missing geometrical margins in undulator.
* Fix a lack of warning when there were too many columns supplied to a rebdsim analysis configuration
  input text file.
* Fix a bug where the PrimaryFirstHit or PrimayrLastHit S coordinate may appear to jump back and forth
  or be discontinuous or wrong. This was fixed by using a more robust directional lookup in the geometry
  on boundaries. Although with the exact same coordinates, Geant4's navigation internally can 'stick'
  to surfaces and it's more robust to use a navigator search with a direction of motion included. For
  the primary trajectory we did a repeated point-only lookup, leading to occasionally the calculated S
  position from the centre of the element being wrong. Even if the primary trajectory isn't stored, a
  light version is used to identify the primary first and last hit points. This only happened in very
  specific circumstances and depended on the physics list used.
* Fix for incorrect curvilinear transforms resulting in wrong S coordinate. This was caused when the
  geometry search fell back to the curvilinear bridge world instead of the regular curvilinear world.
  The transform was used from the regular curvilinear world though, which would be the transform from
  the last lookup. This only affected a small fraction of cases with steps on boundaries on samplers in
  between elements. Most tracking routines do not depend on S / z, so there is little effect to tracking.
* Fix for field map rotation when using a tilt in the field. If the field was tilted by a multiple of
  :math:`\pi/2`, you would not notice. For small finite tilts, the field vector would be rotated wrongly
  due to a double transform.
* Fix a bug where the local coordinates of PrimaryFirstHit and PrimaryLastHit were always zero.
* Fix check that the RF cavity horizontalWidth is larger than the cavity model radius when a cavity model
  is specified for that element.

Output Changes
--------------

* Samplers now have a new variable called `nElectrons` that is the number of electrons on a
  partially stripped ion (if it is one) passing through the sampler. This is filled alongside
  the other ion information.
* `isIon`, `ionA` and `ionZ` are now non-zero when a Hydrogen ion with one or two electrons
  passes through a sampler.
* All extra coordinates are now recorded in the Primary sampler structure no matter if these
  are turned on or not for the samplers.
* New Event.Summary variable `cpuTime`, which is the duration of the event in CPU time in seconds.
* `e1`, `e2`, `hgap`, `fint`, `fintx`, `fintk2`, `fintxk2` variables in Model tree are now filled
  correctly.
* BDSOutputROOTEventCoords member variables are now all vectors instead of single numbers. This
  is to allow the possibility of more than one primary particle as is possible when loading a
  file from an event generator.

Utilities
---------

* pybdsim v2.1.0
* pymadx v1.7.1
* pymad8 v1.5.0
* pytransport v1.3.0


V1.3.3 - 2019 / 05 / 21
=======================

Bug Fixes
---------

* Hot fix for fields not attached to thin elements such as dipole fringes or thin multipoles. This bug
  crept in through a modification to avoid Geant4 getting stuck with strong fields in very narrow gaps
  between layers of geometry in beam pipes, resulting in subsequent bad tracking due to the bad state of
  Geant4 navigators internally. Regression testing has subsequently been introduced to protect against
  this kind of bugging going unnoticed in future.

V1.3.2 - 2019 / 04 / 20
=======================

New Features
------------

* Can now use any particle available through the physics list for a beam particle.
* Generic cross-section biasing can now be used for any particle, including ions.

General
-------

* Tested with Geant4.10.5.p01
* Geometry navigators are reset at the beginning of a run now in a similar way to the start of
  an event to ensure independence between runs - future proofing.
* For Geant4.10.5, we now use the 'low' looping particle thresholds for tracking.
* The 'vacuum' field is now not applied to the container volume of a beam pipe. However, it is
  still applied to the vacuum and beam pipe volumes. This makes the tracking more robust against
  stuck particles in the extremely small gap between volumes.
* The yoke magnetic field now uses a wrapped G4ClassicalRK4 integrator. This wrapper acts as
  a drift for short (< 1um) steps. This makes tracking more robust for secondaries in the yoke.
* Improve testing for user bunch distribution for robustness.
* Increase transverse length safety margin between beam pipes and magnet volumes for safety.
* Translate bunch coordinates in global coordinates backwards by 1x length safety to avoid
  starting on a volume boundary at the start of the event. This is 1nm so will not affect
  tracking results. The local coordinates in the output are identically the same.

Bug Fixes
---------

* Fix strong recreation when using user file supplied bunch distribution. The file was
  always read from the beginning in the past. Now the correct coordinates will be
  read and the event is correctly reproduced.
* Fix userinterface example given changes to sensitive detector manager - simple edit.
* Fix calculated phase offset for rfcavity in the beam line. This was peak at the
  end of the element rather at the middle.
* Fix possible segfault if event aborted due to extra collimator hit information.
* Fix user file beam loader for anomalous particle coordinates generated once at the end
  of a file if the end of the file was a blank line. It would result in all zero coordinates
  and beam energy x1000 for the first particle generated after the end of the file was reached.
* Fix abort of event if unknown particle ID specified in user file beam loader.
* Fix user file distribution file loading for comment lines, incomplete lines and empty
  (white space) lines.
* Fix phase offset calculation for rf cavities with respect to nominal value. Phase would have
  been smaller than intended. It was scaled to :math:`1/2\pi` instead of :math:`2\pi`.
* Fix ambiguity in manual for rf cavities. Time is generally in seconds in BDSIM, however the
  rf cavity took nanoseconds. A time offset of `1*ns` in the input gmad would result in double
  units.
* Fix warning when loading an output file with data loader class when the file was created
  without storing primary coordinates. The warning was related to the PrimaryGlobal branch.
* Fix warnings and artificial killing of particles by high looping particle thresholds for
  Geant4.10.5, which are default. Use the 'low' looping thresholds by default. Issue #268.
* Fix stuck particles by attaching the vacuum field in a beam pipe to every volume in the
  beam pipe apart from the container volume to avoid navigation problems in very thin gaps. Issue #268.
* Remove half-implemented integrator types in internal dictionaries.
* Fixed model-model example conversion Python scripts as these were specific to the developer's computer.
* Fix coil end-piece placement with respect to main magnet body - now includes required length safety
  gap to avoid possible navigation issues with large sized models.
* Fix for exotic particle beams. Can now use any particle available in the physics list.
  Particle definitions now constructed earlier than in the regular physics list call.
* Fix bad tracking in undulators caused by nan values in field caused by querying the field
  at arbitrarily large positions. Limited the range of validity of the field to the beam pipe. The
  field is now no longer attached to the magnets outside the beam pipe.
* Biasing was not attached to components that were found to be unique in construction - i.e. an
  rbend back-to-back with another rbend will not have fringe fields in the middle at the join, so
  is considered a unique construction. This would result in these not having biasing attached.

V1.3 - 2019 / 02 / 27
=====================

Expected Changes To Results
---------------------------

* The density of the surrounding air has changed very slightly to that of the standard
  G4_AIR one.
* Energy deposition in vacuum is now separated into a separate branch and is not mixed
  with general Eloss. Therefore, less energy deposition will be seen in the Eloss branch.
* The minimum kinetic energy option will now be respected when using a Geant4 reference
  physics list, whereas it wasn't before.
* The range cuts can now be applied when using a Geant4 reference physics list if the
  option :code:`g4PhysicsUseBDSIMRangeCuts` is turned on (=1). Previously, these had no
  effect with a Geant4 reference physics list.

New Features
------------

* Support for Geant4.10.5.
* New environment script in :code:`<bdsim-install-dir>/bin/bdsim.sh` to make running BDSIM easier.
* All Geant4 reference physics lists are now available.
* New beam pipe aperture for the CLIC post collision line.
* New jaw collimator element "jcol" with two blocks in the horizontal plane.
* New wire scanner element "wirescanner" with cylindrical wire in a beam pipe.
* Completed CMake to allow user applications based on BDSIM to easily link against it.
* New :code:`dump` beam line element that is an infinite absorber. This prevents simulations
  running for a long time when particles may hit the air at the end of the beam line.
* BDSIM as a class for interfacing. Ability to add custom beam line components.
  See :ref:`interfacing-section`.
* New samplerplacement object that defines an arbitrarily placed sampler in the world that
  may overlap with anything (see :ref:`user-sampler-placement`).
* New importance sampling implementation when using a user-supplied world geometry. (see
  :ref:`physics-bias-importance-sampling`.

* New options:

+----------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+

* Access to data version in DataLoader in analysis.
* External geometry can be supplied as the world volume with the option
  :code:`worldGeometryFile`.
* New complete physics list for crystal channelling to achieve the correct result.
* New ability to specify a different beam particle that is different from the design
  particle used for magnetic field strength calculations (:code:`beamParticleName`).
* Specify the particle assumed for the user file distribution that can be different from
  the design particle.
* New option to use a one turn map generated from MAD-X PTC to correct
  multi-turn tracking for circular machines.
* New option :code:`geant4Macro` and executable option :code:`--geant4Macro` to run an optional
  macro in the visualiser once it's started.
* A warning will print if a user-defined material is more dense than 100g/cm3 as this is much higher
  than any naturally occurring material (on Earth). The simulation will still proceed.
* New optional collimator output structure in event made per collimator with prefix
  "COLL\_". Controlled by new option :code:`collimatorInfo`.
* New mini-summary of collimators in Model tree when :code:`collimatorInfo` option is used.
* New units "PeV", "J", and variations thereof for energy.
* New parameter for collimator elements :code:`minimumKineticEnergy` that allows the user to kill
  particles below a certain kinetic energy in a collimator.

General
-------

* All collimators now require a material to be specified and the default copper has
  been removed. This is because it strongly affects the results obtained and defaults
  should not be relied upon for this.
* The turn number for energy deposition hits is now automatically stored if
  a circular model is used.
* The `sensitiveBeamlineComponents` option has now been renamed to `sensitiveOuter`
  to better reflect its functionality. The old option is still accepted.
* The `tunnelSensitive` option has now been renamed to `storeElossTunnel` to be
  more consistent with the other sensitivity options. The old option is still
  accepted.
* The generic beam line element `element` now supports angle and the beam line
  will be curved by this amount.
* The world volume is now sensitive and can record energy deposition. Geant4.10.3 upwards
  is required to record both this information and the energy leaving the world
  as this requires G4MultiSensitiveDetector.
* New tests for testing backwards compatibility of analysis tool with previous data version.
* "Model Preparation" is now "Model Conversion" in the manual to be clearer.
* Visualisation now uses macro search path to look for visualisation macro in the installation
  directory then the build directory of BDSIM.
* In recreate mode, there is explicit print out about when the seed is set and if if was successfully
  loaded from the output file.
* The Cherenkov example has now been updated to show 3 materials (air, water, YAG).
* Fixes from static code analysis for virtual functions called in constructors of factories,
  shadow member variables and initialisation of crystal variables in parser.
* Significant reduction in use of the singleton pattern for beam pipe, magnet yoke,
  tunnel and geometry factories.
* Reduced memory usage for energy deposition hits by removing unused numbers stored each time.
* Reduced memory usage for energy deposition hits when not using extra variables such as the 'links'.


Materials
---------

* The materials construction in src/BDSMaterials.cc was checked through thoroughly.
* "air" is now G4_AIR instead of custom BDSIM air (similar composition). The old air is now "airbdsim".
* The refractive index data for optical and cherenkov physics has been added on top of G4_AIR
  as well as "airbdsim".
* "airbdsim" now has a density of 1.225mg/cm3.
* "bp_carbonmonoxide" material now has correct pressure (previously near infinite).
* Fixed double density for the following materials. They would have been extremely dense.
  
   - "berylliumcopper"
   - "stainless_steel_304L"
   - "stainless_steel_304L_87K"
   - "stainless_steel_316LN"
   - "stainless_steel_316LN_87K"
   - "tungsten_heavy_alloy"
   - "fusedsilica"
   - "n-bk7"
   - "yag"
   - "pet"
   - "lhc_rock"

* "niobium" is now "niobium_2k" to better reflect the unusual temperature.
* "nbti" is now "nbti_4k" to better reflect the unusual temperature.
* "waterCkov" has been removed. "water" or "G4_WATER" (the same) should be used. The refractive
  index data has been added to G4_WATER material.

Developer Changes
-----------------

* The BDSGeometryComponent base class now has the ability to specify which
  sensitive detector should be attached in a map using the BDSSDType enum. There is no default
  sensitive detector (previously general energy deposition) as the developer must be explicit
  about what sensitivity they want so nothing unexpected can happen.
* BDSBeamline can now return indices of beam line elements of a certain type.
* All sensitive detector classes have been renamed as have the accessor functions in BDSSDManager.
  This is to make the naming more consistent.
  
Bug Fixes
---------

* Fixed reloading user file when reading more particles than defined in the file.
* Fixed "pt" column in user file for reading particle PDG IDs. The first particle would be read
  correctly and all subsequent particles would revert to the beam definition.
* Fixed infinite tracking from nans return from field map when BDSIM format
  field map file was lacking lower and upper limits.
* Fixed incorrect writing of optional sampler information.
* The `sensitiveBeamPipe` option now works and controls whether the beam pipe produces
  energy loss or not. This does not affect the physics, merely whether output
  information is generated or not.
* The `sensitiveOuter` (formerly `sensitiveBeamlineComponents`) option has
  been fixed and now controls whether the parts outside the beam pipe in an
  element record energy loss or not.
* Degrader and undulator did not record energy deposition.
* Energy deposition is now correctly recorded when tracks are artificially killed.
* Fix crystal channelling with cylindrical and torus shaped crystals. The crystal implementation
  only works along the local X direction of any solid. Fixed by using a G4DisplacedSolid to
  allow use of more advanced geometries than a box.
* Fix channelling physics for standard EM and hadronic processes as this requires process biasing.
* Fix A and Z being the wrong way around for ions in samplers.
* Charge now correctly recorded in primaries and in samplers for partially stripped ions.
* Solenoid tracking fixed. Fringes are constructed as appropriate according to integrator set.
* Fix possible nan values given to Geant4 tracking with miscalculated auto-scaling value for
  field maps.
* Fix setting default seed state for random number generator if using recreate mode
  and progressing beyond an event stored in the file.
* Fix setting the energy level of an ion - wasn't set from input.
* SQL geometry factory didn't clean up after repeated use. This geometry isn't
  generally supported.
* Fixed a bug where very weak actions on particles in tracking would not be taken due to
  too stringent tests of finite numbers. This would result in particles with small offsets
  in magnets or particles with high momentum that would see only very small deviations being
  tracked as if it were a drift.
* Fixed segfault crash from ROOT with rebdsim when there were more dimensions in the variables
  than the declared number of dimensions. For example, "y:x" for Histogram1D.
* Fixed rare bug where segfault would occur in trying to account for energy deposition of
  artificially killed particles.
* Fix memory leak of sampler structures (relatively small).
* Fixed parsing of + or - symbols with ion definition. Now supports H- ion.
* Fixed very slow memory leak associated with the primary trajectory. only visible for very
  large numbers of events.
* Fixed dipole tracking for off-charge ions - reverts to backup integrator.
* Fixed Pythonic range iteration of Event tree when trying to look at Info branch. Conflicted with
  Info method of TObject. Now renamed to Summary.
* Fixed catching the construction of dipoles with too large an angle. Limit rbends and unsplit
  sbends to a maximum angle of pi/2, limit the maximum angle of all other dipoles to 2 pi.
  
Output Changes
--------------

* "Info" branch of the Event and Run trees are now "Summary". This is to avoid conflict with
  ROOT TObject::Info() that could result in broken analysis or range iteration. The DataLoader
  class in analysis (used by pybdsim.Data.Load) is backwards compatible. In the case of loading
  older data with updated software, there will still be a member called Info that the data will
  be loaded into. Python range iteration cannot be used in this case.
* "TunnelHit" is now "EnergyLossTunnel" to be consistent. `rebdsim` and the analysis DataLoader
  class (both Python and ROOT) are backwards compatible and both TunnelHit and ElossTunnel are
  available. Only the correct one is filled with loaded data during analysis.
* Much more granular control of what is stored in the output. See new options in 'new' section
  above.
* Vacuum energy deposition separated from general energy deposition and now in its own branch.
* Memory usage (for Mac & Linux) added at the end of each event in event info. This
  is the memory usage of the whole program at that point including event independent
  quantities such as the model.
* Boolean flag store in even info as to whether the primary was absorbed in a collimator or not.
* New options to control level of output as described in table in new features..
* Tunnel energy deposition hits now respond to the :code:`storeElossXXXX` options to control the
  level of detail with extra variables of their output.
* New class BDSOutputROOTEventLossWorld for a record of coordinates when a particle leaves a volume,
  use currently for exiting the world.
* New structures ("branches") in the `Event` tree called :code:`ElossWorld` and
  :code:`ElossWorldExit` for energy deposition in the world material and energy leaving
  the world (and therefore the simulation) respectively.
* New members in :code:`Event.Info` that are the integrated energy deposited in various parts
  for that event. These are for convenience and are the integrals of the various Eloss parts.

V1.2 - 2018 / 08 / 26
=====================

Highlights
----------

* :code:`outerDiameter` is now :code:`horizontalWidth` to better describe its function (backwards-compatible).
* Fixed dipole scaling with (the default) bdsimmatrix integrator set.
* Solenoid tracking fixed.

New Features
------------

* New options to activate extra models in em_extra physics list.
* New :code:`crystalcol` element for channelling crystals.
* New :code:`crystal` definition in parser.
* New "channelling" physics list for Geant4 crystal channelling physics process.
* Field maps need not be in `x`, `y`, `z`, `t` order and lower dimension fields (i.e. 1D or 2D) can
  be made for any dimension, i.e. it is now possible to specify a 1D field along the `z` direction.
* Rebdsim can now analyse a select range of events specified by "EventStart" and "EventEnd" options.
  Issue #240.
* Placements can now be made with respect to S,x, and y in the main beam line, with respect to a beam line
  element and lastly in global Cartesian coordinates.
* Samplers will no longer be automatically attached (with :code:`sample, all;`) to dipoles with finite
  pole face rotations, as this may lead to tracking issues in Geant4. A developer option can force
  this on, although this is not recommended. Issue #241.
* `hkicker` and `vkicker` strength can be specified via the magnetic field :code:`B` instead of
  `hkick` or `vkick`.
* Support for dipole poleface curvature in tracking.
* Pole face rotations and fringe fields are now available for hkickers and vkickers, both thick and thin.
* New ability to specify the colour of any magnet and most elements through custom colour definition.
* Geant4's DNA physics lists have been added.
* Solenoid fringe fields have been implemented and are on by default. They are controlled with
  the `includeFringeFields` option.
  
General
-------

* :code:`outerDiameter` is now :code:`horizontalWidth` to better describe its function
  (backwards-compatible). This naming was from a time when BDSIM could only create cylindrical
  magnets and beam pipes. Given it can now create more complicated geometry, this name is not
  a good choice and so has been renamed. BDSIM still supports the old syntax.
* :code:`vhratio` is now consistent with vkickers and refers to the vertical and horizontal ratio in
  the lab frame.
* The horizontal width of kickers is now taken from :code:`outerDiameter`. Previously, :code:`outerDiameter`
  corresponded to the height and :code:`vhratio` was really the horizontal-to-vertical ratio in
  the lab frame.
* Synchrotron radiation is now disabled with em_extra physics list (use dedicated
  synchrad physics list). Avoids the double registration of the physics process.
* New CMake variable ROOTSYS to allow easy specification of a specific ROOT installation.
* Visualisation of trajectories significantly faster (~10x) due to different strategy with Geant4
  visualisation system.
* "ang" unit is added to the parser for Angstroms.
* BDSIM will now exit if there is no space to make the necessary circular management objects
  (teleporter and terminator).
* long int used explicitly instead of int for event indices in analysis.
* Reimplemented primary first hit and last hit. Last hit is now the end point of the
  primary trajectory. No more linear memory usage with tracking time.
* Beam pipe extent calculation re-implemented and much less simplistic - used
  to check whether a pipe will fit inside a magnet.
* Mini-contents for syntax section of manual, as it's grown to a large size.
* New rmatrix element (experimental).
* EM Dissociation is now applicable up to 100 TeV.
* Significantly improved aperture shape checking for whether beam pipe will fit inside a magnet.
* BDSIM now recognises all elements by chemical abbreviation. These are found in the Geant4 NIST
  database by automatically prefixing the name with "G4\_". Issue #236.
* `circle` distribution z and t distributions are now reversed to be consistent with all other generators.
  These were T0 - dt and are now T0 + dt. Distribution will be different for the same seed as compared
  to a previous version of BDSIM.
* `square` distribution now calls random number generator for each coordinate every time for
  consistency. Distribution will be different for the same seed as compared
  to a previous version of BDSIM.
* Memory usage for sampler hits has been significantly reduced with no affect to the output
  information stored.
* The "water" material in BDSIM is now the NIST G4_WATER material and no longer the one
  that was defined by BDSIM.
* New options for physics processes in em_extra.

Output Changes
--------------

* Data v3 incremented from v2.
* Options class (GMAD::optionsBase) number is incremented in output.
* New optional stepLength variable in Eloss part of Event Tree with option
  :code:`storeElossStepLength` to use this data.
* New optional preStepKineticEnergy in Eloss part of Event Tree with option
  :code:`storeElossPreStepKineticEnergy` to use this data.
* Energy Loss class (BDSOutputROOTEventLoss) number is increment in output.
* Tilt, offsetX, offsetY and material are added to the Model Tree output.
* Model class (BDSOutputROOTEventModel) number is incremented in output.
* Model information extended to provide everything necessary to make machine diagrams.
* New option :code:`storeModel` to turn off model storage in the output.
* Even Info class (BDSOutputROOTEventInfo) number is incremented in output.
* Event.Info now has a Boolean of whether the primary particle hit something or not.
* Samplers are **no longer** placed next to elements with angled faces when using the :code:`bdsimtwo`,
  :code:`geant4`, or :code:`geant4dp` integrator sets.
* Units are now written to the ASCII survey output for each column.
* New output class :code:`BDSOutputROOTEventCoords` to store coordinates for primary global coordinates.
* New branch called "PrimaryGlobal" in Event tree that stores the coordinates used with Geant4 in
  the global Cartesian frame.
* Sampler name now stored in Orbit output from rebdsimOrbit to make sampler matching possible.

Bug Fixes
---------

* Fixed solenoid tracking. The anti-spiralling code in the dipole integrator that is designed
  to stop infinite spiralling of low energy particles in strong fields was causing incorrect
  tracking in solenoids. This has been fixed with the re-implementation of the solenoid matrix
  and now includes the fringe effects. Issue #255.
* Fixed tracking bug where particle in very niche coordinates may reflect from a sampler
  at the end of a dipole with a very strongly angled pole face. #Issue 241.
* Fixed automatic tunnel building algorithm, which accumulated wrong variables, leading to
  problems when thin elements such as fringe fields or thin multipoles were included.
* Further improvements made to tunnel building algorithm for magnets with tilt. Issue #243.
* Fixed length check for very short elements. Small drifts would cause a crash from
  Geant4 due to invalid parameters - occurred as length check was wrong.
* Fixed non-positive definite warnings for no energy spread and time spread when using
  a Gaussian beam in a composite beam definition.
* Fixed Gauss beams used in composite distribution.
* Fixed the problem where no particles were being tracked when using a userfile bunch distribution with only one column.
* Fixed bug where last particle was missed from user bunch distribution file.
* Fixed corrupted example files for userfile bunch distribution. Issue #244.
* Fixed cutting planes in G4CutTubs constructor for tunnel in Geant up to Geant4.10.2.p02
  from too short tunnel section.
* Reimplemented the method of finding primary first and last hit so BDSIM doesn't need to
  save the whole trajectory for the primary. This fixes the behaviour of linearly growing
  unbounded memory usage when tracking for a long time in a ring. Issue #246, #242.
* Optical calculation now works for sub-relativistic positrons.
* ATF2 MAD-X output was not included in worked example as advertised - now included.
* Fixed scaling variable used when scaling a field map to a decapole magnet strength.
* Survey units for magnetic fields are now fixed from kT to T.
* Fixed issue where C-shaped vkickers and hkickers would ignore :code:`yokeOnInside`. Issue #251.
* Fixed possible overlap in vkicker, hkicker, and h-style dipole geometry with highly asymmetric
  beam pipes.
* Fixed incorrect report that beam pipe wouldn't fit in magnet for various aperture shapes. Issue #253.
* Fixed issue where the option :code:`writePrimaries = 0` would result in the hits for the first sampler
  being written to the primary sampler structure. Issue #245.
* Fixed lack of interaction with vacuum when processes biased - due to a specific Geant4 version.
  Issue #220.
* Fixed incorrect dipole scaling. Issue #239.
* Fixed E0 spread in `ring` beam distribution, which was finite in contrast to the description
  that it is always the central value.
* Fixed reproducibility for the `ring` distribution that didn't use the same random number generator
  as every other distribution. Coordinates will be different for this distribution for the same seed now.
* Fixed inconsistency of `t` and `z` coordinate in `square` beam distribution.
* `square` beam distribution now varies with :code:`envelopeT`.
* Fixed S coordinate in output. Issues #247 and #248.
* Fixed the setting of the sampler diameter where the user specifies a smaller one than that calcualted
  from the minimum bending radius.

* Full support for dipole fringe fields and pole faces in tracking.
* Full low energy (sub-relativistic) tracking.
* Validation against PTC for sub-relativistic to high energy.

* Control over dipole proportions with global and per element options `vhRatio`,
  `coilWidthFraction` and `coilHeightFraction`.

* New option in rebdsim to turn off histogram merging (for speed).
* Analysis classes have member names changed to match those in the output files, i.e. "eloss" is
  now "Eloss" in `bdsim/analysis/Event.hh`.

V0.8 - 2015 / 08 / 10
=====================

New Features
------------

* Tunnel geometry and flexible tunnel factories for different styles
* Tunnel read out geometry introduced for coordinates along tunnel axis
* C++11 adopted (required)
* `stopSecondaries` option
* Removed dependency on boost (issue #57)
* Restructured examples directory - top level contains only full machines
  and sub-directories contain features
* Example documentation in manual and in place beside each example with
  example screenshots
* Updated python utilities *pybdsim v0.1*, *pymadx v0.1*, *pymad8 v0.1* and *robdsim v0.2*
* Repeated components are not duplicated in memory - previously, they would
  be repeatedly constructed. Reduced memory footprint.
* Component information comes from Physical Volumes instead of Logical Volumes
* Improved manual documentation
* Improved Doxygen documentation
* Rubbish collection for all objects, rather than relying on only one run and
  Geant4 (partial) rubbish collection.
* String representation of enum types leading to more readable output
* Introduced ability to switch to new modular physics lists with flexible
  construction and addition of physics lists without hard-coded names for each
  combination - the user must turn this on explicitly

Bug fixes
---------

Geometry
^^^^^^^^
* Geometry overlaps (issues #55 and #58)
* Transform3d fix (issue #54)
* Fixed placement of objects outside x,z global plane - rotation bug, similarly
  for read-out geometry placement.
* Fixed broken circular control - bug was introduced in v0.7 - (issue #51).
* Strict checking of read out geometry construction to avoid invalid solids that
  would cause Geant4 to exit and BDSIM to crash.
* Strict checking on teleporter volume construction for circular machines that
  would cause Geant4 to exit and BDSIM to crash.
* Fixed calculation of length of sector bend magnet that would cause it to be
  slightly short - introduced in v0.7.
* Removed stored axes of rotation due to better implementation in BDSBeamline,
  avoiding duplication of information.
* Fixed issue of zero angle rbends causing a crash (issue #44).
* Event number print-out is now dynamic and based on the number of events to be
  generated. It is also controllable with the `printModuloFraction` option.
* Protected against bad user-specified values of `lengthSafety` to avoid
  geometry overlaps.
* Improved parser speed.

Physics
^^^^^^^
* SR radiation fixed in dipole (issue #53).
* Removed continuous synchrotron radiation, as it traps particles in low step-size
  infinite loop.
* Removal of poorly set deltaIntersection, chordStepMinimum and lengthSafety
  variables from examples - these should be left unset unless the user knows
  their purpose.

Output
^^^^^^
* Changed all transverse output units to **metres** - manual updated accordingly.
* Changed `z` in ASCII output to **global Z** instead of local z.
* Recorded energy in output is now unweighted, but energy recorded in convenient
  energy loss histogram is. Could have lead to double weighting previously.
* Fixed global coordinates being written out as local coordinates in ROOT
  output.
* Random number generator seed state not written out when no output is specified.

Parser
^^^^^^
* Return error if superfluous arguments are present (issue #56).
* Make parser more robust against duplicate element names (issue #43).
* Fixed warnings about compiling c as c++ being deprecated behaviour.

General
^^^^^^^
* Fixed wrong print out warning due to logic error (issue #51).
* Fixed boundary effects of energy deposition (issue #52).
* Fixed large memory leak for events with large number of particles - was due to
  accumulation of BDSTrajectory objects.
