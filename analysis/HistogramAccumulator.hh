/**
 * @brief Class to accumulate and merge histograms in different ways.
 * 
 * This acts as a base class to accumulate a single histogram from many.
 * The default implementation is to calculate the mean and the standard
 * error on the mean, however, the AccumulateSingleValue() function is virtual
 * and may be overridden to provide different functionality.
 * 
 * TH1 is the base class of all ROOT histograms so even 2 and 3D histograms
 * can be supplied through a TH1 pointer. These are statically cast to TH1D,
 * TH2D and TH3D based on the number of dimensions (1,2 or 3 only).
 *
 * A result histogram name can be specified. Note ROOT uses this to create
 * objects in the currently open file (lots of static stuff) and therefore
 * this should be unique from the supplied base histogram name!
 * 
 * Each instance is single use. Once terminated, the accumulation should
 * not be used.
 * 
 * The algorithm used to calculate the mean and variance is one that supports
 * online calculation and is numerically stable. 
 * 
 * Normally, at least 2 entries should be accumulated to calculate the variance
 * and to avoid nans from 1/(n-1), however, in this special case, the bin error
 * is set to 0.
