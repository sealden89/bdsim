/**
 * @brief Class to combine histograms of mean with error on mean.
 * 
 * This uses the functionality of HistogramAccumulator to accumulate
 * a combined mean and error on the mean from histograms already containing
 * means and error the mean. i.e. The incoming histograms have already
 * averaged many (at least 2) events.
 *
 * This overrides two methods for the accumulation but the inheritance
 * saves on repetition in the constructor and structures.
