/**
 * @brief Transform in beam line that takes up no space.
 *
 * This applies a transformation to cumulative curvilinear
 * coordinates as the beam line is built allowing an arbitrary
 * rotation or displacement of the reference coordinates from
 * that point on. A tilt or offset should be used instead of 
 * two of these in conjunction (sandwiching) to offset a particular
 * BDSAcceleratorComponent.
