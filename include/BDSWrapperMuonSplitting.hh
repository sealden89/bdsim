/**
 * @brief Wrapper process to produce more muons by resampling the process.
 *
 * Wrap a process. If that process post-step do-it particle change produces a
 * muon, then resample it until we get the desired number of muons. Keep only the
 * new muons. Put together the original secondaries (that are not muons) with the
 * now N muons and weight each muon by w_i * 1/N.
 *
 * Possibility of 2 splitting factors at threshold energies with linear interpolation
 * of the splitting factor in between (rounded to the nearest integer). The splitting
 * ramps up from 0.8x the 1st threshold in kinetic energy. This is a crude linear way
 * to compensate for a possibly exponential in spectra as we don't know the original
 * function.
 *
 * Optional flag for excluding weight = 1 incoming particles for the case of heavy
 * cross-section biasing used separately to this class (e.g. decay).
