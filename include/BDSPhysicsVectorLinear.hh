 *  @brief A vector of some values vs Ek that are linearly interpolated.
 *
 *  The class G4PhysicsVectorLinear provides similar functionality but is
 *  more complex and suited to reading in from a text file which is too
 *  complex for what we want here. This is just a very simple 2 column
 *  lookup with linear interpolation.
