 * @brief Loader to use any HepMC3 compatible file.
 * 
 * Interface to use HepMC3 library to load a variety of files.
 * 
 * This is largely based on Geant4's example
 * examples/extended/eventgenerator/HepMC/HepMCEx01, however it
 * has been rewritten to use HepMC3 library rather than HepMC2.
 * Additionally, the interface has been written based on HepMC3
 * example "convert_example" to use multiple reader classes.
