/**
 * @brief Factory for rhombus aperture model beampipes.
 * 
 * This is a diamond shaped aperture. It optionally has a corner radius
 * for rounded edges. aper1 is the full extent of what would be the unrounded
 * corner in x; aper2 is the full extent of what would be the the unrounded
 * corner in y. aper3 is the radius of curvature for the corners and is optional,
 * with the default value of 0.
 *
 * Constructed using an extruded solid with a series of points.
