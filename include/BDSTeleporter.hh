/**
 * @brief An element that unnaturally shifts the beam across its length - a fudge volume.
 * 
 * In some circular lattices, the input lattice doesn't match perfectly at the end, typically
 * due to numerical rounding issues accumulated over thousands of components. This is not
 * because of the geometry construction, but purely in the input MADX or gmad description.
 * Normal tracking programs don't show this offset as they really track through a sequence
 * of maps or functions and just apply them in a loop - it is defacto periodic. However, 
 * with real 3D geometry in global cartesian coordinates, we must artificially make the
 * lattice periodic. Enter the teleporter. This transports particles across its length
 * while maintaining the exact same transverse coordinates, which is normally unphysical.
