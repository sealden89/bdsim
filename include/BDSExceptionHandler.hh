/**
 * @brief Handler that overrides Geant4's behaviour back to a normal exception.
 * 
 * If left alone, Geant4 will use abort() which won't exit safely. Therefore,
 * we use the exception handler they provide and change the behaviour to throwing
 * one of our exceptions which we generally require to be caught.
 *
 * Overall BDSIM can be expected to throw a BDSException or a std::exception.
