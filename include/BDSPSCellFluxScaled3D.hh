/**
 * @brief Primitive scorer for cell flux in a 3D mesh with a conversion factor.
 *
 * The cell flux (step length / cell volume) * weight is also multiplied by a
 * conversion factor (just a number) as listed vs energy in a supplied file. The
 * default is none and just a factor of 1.
 *
 * The implementation also differs from G4PSCellFlux3D as we cache the volume
 * to avoid repeated calculation.
