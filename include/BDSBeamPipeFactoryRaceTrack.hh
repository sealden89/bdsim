/**
 * @brief Factory for racetrack aperture model beampipes.
 * 
 * This is a rectangular aperture with curved edges. In the 
 * positive quadrante (+ve x & y) the user specifies (x,y) as
 * well as radius r that forms a quarter circle from this point.
 * This is reflected to the other quadrants. To achieve this using
 * Geant4 solids, a vector of points is built up transversely in 
 * clockwise order to form a solid G4Polyhedra. To create the beam
 * pipe, two are created and subtracted. The number of points in the
 * curved sections can also be chosen but increasing the detail will
 * also reduce the efficiency of course.
 *
 * aper1,2 and 3 are used to represent x,y and r respectively. aper4 is ignored.
