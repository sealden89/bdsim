 * @brief Modified G4MultiSensitiveDetector that retains order and passes hits in sequence.
 *
 * Generated G4VHit* objects are passed in order to each successive SD that should
 * inherit BDSSensitiveDetector. If no hit is stored for that SD, a nullptr is inserted
 * into the vector. That way, the vector will always have the same length for a given SD.
