/**
 * @brief Register for all fields to be built and volumes to be attached to.
 * 
 * This keeps a registry of the field info (the template for a field) and the 
 * volume to attach it to, so all fields can actually be constructed at one
 * time irrespective of when they're apparently 'created' in the geometry / 
 * individual BDSAcceleratorComponents.
 * 
 * This register does not retain ownership of anything so multiple logical volumes
 * may be safely registered along with a single BDSFieldInfo instance.
