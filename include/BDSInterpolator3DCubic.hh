 * @brief Cubic interpolation over 3d array.
 * 
 * Does not own array - so multiple interpolators could be used on same data.
 * 
 * This uses a tricubic algorithm to interpolate a 3d array and return
 * the value at any arbitrary point. If the point lies outside the array
 * the default value for the templated parameter is returned (typically 0).
 * Therefore, the field drops to 0 outside the specified region.
