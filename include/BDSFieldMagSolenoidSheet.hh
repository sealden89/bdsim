/**
 * @brief Class that provides the magnetic field due to a cylinder of current.
 *
 * This follows the parameterisation and uses the algorithm for the generalised complete
 * elliptical integral as described in:
 *
 * Cylindrical Magnets and ideal Solenoids, N. Derby and S. Olbert, American Journal of
 * Physics **78**, 229 (2010); https://doi.org/10.1119/1.3256157 and also at
 * https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.3880.
 *
 * The field is calculated in cylindrical coordinates. A complete description is in the manual.
