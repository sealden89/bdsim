/**
 * @brief Holder for all temporary files created by BDSIM.
 * 
 * A single place where all temporary file names are held. The
 * class determines a directory to put them when required and 
 * cleans up all temporary files upon deletion.
 *
 * Has a separate method to initialise the temporary directory
 * so that it's possible to delete the singleton at the end of the
 * program without having to construct the temporary directory
 * and possibly encountering an error.
