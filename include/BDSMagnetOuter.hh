 * @brief An object for both the returned magnet outer body but also a
 * tight fitting container for the whole magnet.
 * 
 * Mostly BDSGeometryComponent but with the 
 * addition of a suggested container volume for the whole magnet body
 * as the magnet outer section is typically the outside of the magnet
 * and only the magnet factory knows its true shape and can make a well
 * fitting container.
