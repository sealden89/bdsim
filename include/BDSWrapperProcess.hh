 * processes provide a correct current interaction length necessary for tracking.
 * This function isn't virtual so we can't override just that sadly. Therefore,
 * we override the 3 big functions where the member variable currentInteractionLength
 * would be updated and copy it out of the wrapped process. Even if this is updated in
 * Geant4 now we need to retain backwards compatibility.
