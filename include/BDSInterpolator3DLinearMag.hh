/** 
 * @brief Linear interpolation over 3d array including magnitude interpolation.
 * 
 * Does not own array - so multiple interpolators could be used on same data.
 * 
 * This uses a trilinear algorithm to interpolate a 3d array and return
 * the value at any arbitrary point. If the point lies outside the array
 * the default value for the templated parameter is returned (typically 0).
 * Therefore, the field drops to 0 outside the specified region.
 *
 * This is based on the following article:
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilinear_interpolation
