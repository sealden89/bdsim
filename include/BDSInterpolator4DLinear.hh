/** 
 * @brief Linear interpolation over 4d array.
 * 
 * Does not own array - so multiple interpolators could be used on same data.
 * 
 * This uses a quad-linear algorithm to interpolate a 3d array and return
 * the value at any arbitrary point. If the point lies outside the array
 * the default value for the templated parameter is returned (typically 0).
 * Therefore, the field drops to 0 outside the specified region.
 * 
 * This is based on an extension of the trilinear algorithm described in 
 * BDSInterpolator3DLinear.hh.
