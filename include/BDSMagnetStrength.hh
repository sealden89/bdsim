/**
 * @brief Efficient storage of magnet strengths.
 *
 * Based on std::map, this class stores magnet strengths. 
 *
 * As there will be one of 
 * these for every magnet and they may in future have to go up to high order 
 * normal plus skew (~40 doubles), it is more efficient to only store the required
 * parameters. A pure quadrupole has no need of k20s, but a multipole may do. A static
 * vector contains the possible magnet strength parameters that can be checked against.
 * If a parameter is not specified in the map, its value is return as 0.
 *
 * Angle in rad, Field in Geant4 units. k strengths as original (ie not converted to G4).
 *
