/**
 * @brief A wrapper to achieve 2D reflection of a minimal quadrupole field solve.
 *
 * NOTE: This should only be used for arrays where the spatial spacing is the same
 * in both x and y - ie xStep and yStep are the same, otherwise the field map will be
 * distorted.
 * 
 * This allows a small 2pi/8 segment between the x axis and y=x in the positive
 * quadrant to be reflected to represent a quadrupole.  Ie relfected about y=z
 * in the positive quadrant (A); reflected and inverted in the negative quadrant (C);
 * reflected and y field component inverted in quadrant (B); reflected and x component
 * inverted in quadrant (D)
 *
 * B | A
 * -----
 * C | D
 *
 * This owns the array it wraps.
 *
 * This makes an array look 4 times bigger than it is - ie 2x as big in x and y. The
 * array coordinates are correspondingly shifted. What would've been (0,0) in a 100x100
 * array will now be at index (101,101).
 *
 * This is reflected about 0,0 and can only be so given the implementation.
 *
 * Some interfaces are overloaded and some aren't as are required to be (sizeX for example).
 * The ostream << writes both the raw array and the reflected version too.
 *
 * Note, by return a reference to a non-const member returnValue that may be updated by another
 * query, thread safety could be an issue.
 *
 * The reflection *includes* the diagonal line in the array.
