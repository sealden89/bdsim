/**
 * @brief Abstract class that represents a component of an accelerator.
 *
 * It must be constructed with a name, length (arc), angle it induces 
 * (x,z plane in the local coordinates of the component) in the 
 * reference trajectory and a string representing its type. The class 
 * has no concept of its position in the beamline or in global coordinates. 
 * This information is contained in an instance of BDSBeamlineElement.
 * 
 * This is an abstract class as the derived class must provide the 
 * implementation of BuildContainerLogicalVolume() that constructs at 
 * least a single volume, which would be assumed to be a container if greater
 * geometry hierarchy is constructed. This is the minimum required so that an 
 * instance of the derived class will operate with the rest of the placement 
 * machinery in BDSIM. The derived class should override Build() to add further 
 * geometry. If Build() is overridden, the base class 
 * BDSAcceleratorComponent::Build() should be called first. This calls
 * BuildContainerVolume() and sets the visual attributes of it.
 * 
 * The class provides deferred construction through the Initialise() function
 * to allow two stage construction if it's required. So, although a derived
 * class is instantiated, the geometry isn't constructed until Initialise() is
 * called.
 * 
 * Note, the geometry of any derived component should be nominally constructed
 * along local z axis (beam direction) and x,y are transverse dimensions in a 
 * right-handed coordinate system.
 *
 * The 'length' of the accelerator component is the arc length, which corresponds
 * to the angle given.  The chord length is internally calculated from the arc
 * length and the angle.  Therefore, the chord length must never be given.
 *
 * The optional input and output face normal (unit) vectors are w.r.t. the 
 * incoming / outgoing reference trajectory and NOT the local geometry of the 
 * component.
