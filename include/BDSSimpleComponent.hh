/**
 * @brief A BDSAcceleratorComponent wrapper for BDSGeometryComponent.
 * 
 * This allows a BDSGeometryComponent to be placed in a beam line by
 * being a necessary BDSAcceleratorComponent, which gives the minimal 
 * information to BDSBeamline - name, length & angle.
 * 
 * This inherits the objects from the BDSGeometryComponent and therefore
 * effectively owns it without deleting it explicitly as a whole object.
 *
 * Face normal (unit) vectors are w.r.t. the incoming / outgoing reference 
 * trajectory and NOT the local geometry of the component.
