/**
 * @brief Information about a registered sampler.
 * 
 * This class contains the information about a constructed
 * and placed sampler. The sampler registry holds a vector
 * of this class. This class is NOT a template to build a
 * sampler, but a record of what was built (unlike the other
 * BDSXXXXInfo classes in BDSIM.
 * 
 * This does not own the BDSSampler instance, merely keeps a 
 * record of it. Note, there can be many placements and therefore
 * registrations of one sampler instance. This also means that the
 * compiler provided default copy constructor is safe.
