/**
 * @brief Colour scale based on magma colour map.
 * 
 * This class linearly interpolates between values.
 * 
 * The colour map is "magma" created by Stefan van der Walt 
 * ([@stefanv](https://github.com/stefanv)) and Nathaniel Smith 
 * ([@njsmith](https://github.com/njsmith)). Full credit goes to them for
 * their excellent colour scale.
 * Details can be found here: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html
 * The values hard-coded in this class come from a json file on
 * [@stefanv](https://github.com/stefanv), in the package "scale-color-perceptual",
 * specifically https://github.com/stefanv/scale-color-perceptual/blob/master/rgb/magma.json
 * 
 * This file has 256 values and has been cut by a fraction of 1/8 to 32 values as
 * we will linearly interpolate anyway and want to save memory.
