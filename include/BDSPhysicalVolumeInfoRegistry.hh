/**
 * @brief A registry of physical volume info instances that
 * can be searched. 
 * 
 * This actually contains two registries - one
 * for read out geometry and one for general geometry. The reason 
 * for this is that the physical volumes of the general geometry are
 * much more numerous and would increase the search time of whole registry
 * - important as it'll be used for every single energy deposition track.
 * However, if the read out geometry is used for an element, then we need only
 * register that as all hits will occur inside the read out geometry and that
 * can be used for info lookup. This means only one registration per beamline
 * element. It is not a formal requirement that each component have a read out
 * geometry (yet) so this look up should work without it.  Adding all the physical
 * volumes of a component will lead to polluting the main register with many more
 * volumes. This can be revisited and simplified if we force / require that every
 * element has a read out volume.
