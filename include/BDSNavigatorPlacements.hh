/**
 * @brief Extra G4Navigator to get coordinate transforms for placement world.
 * 
 * This class provides a simple transform to the frame of a volume found at
 * a point in the provided world as long as it is not the world volume. No
 * special advancing or boundary checking is done - simple yes or no.
 * 
 * This class provides a static auxiliary navigator that each derived 
 * class can use. Making the auxiliary navigator static is not done
 * to reduce memory usage but because navigating from an unknown place 
 * to anywhere in the geometry is much more costly than a relative move
 * in the geometry.
 *
 * See InitialiseTransform() documentation for why we have mutable variables.
