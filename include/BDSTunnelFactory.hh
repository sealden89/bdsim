/**
 * @brief A singleton class that provides an interface to all tunnel factories.
 *
 *  Each function of a BDSTunnelFactoryBase derived
 * class is implemented here, but with the wrapper for BDSTunnelType
 * which is used in this class to utilise the appropriate factory. Note,
 * this class does not own the other factories or keep references to them - 
 * they are accessed through (global) singleton accessors.
