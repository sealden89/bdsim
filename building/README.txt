cvmfs: some trial scripts to build for CVMFS - not used or maintained. CVMFS build system
is in a separate repository.

depend: very old bash script system to build all dependencies. Not supported nor used. Typically,
we get our dependencies through package managers (e.g. MacPorts / APT)

docker: trial docker setup scripts to create a docker image.
